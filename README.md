# Pseudo-Random Number Generator and Controller
This project was developed as part of my application for a JetBrains internship. It consists of two Python programs that interact with each other through standard input and output:

    Program A: Acts as a pseudo-random number generator.
    Program B: Controls Program A by sending commands and processing responses.
## Usage
In the repository directory run the following command
  python program_B.py
This will start program B which in trun controlls program A aswells as shuts it down.
## Testing
I am using unittest library. To run the tests run this 
  python test.py
Or, for more detailed test output:
  python -m unittest test.py
## requirments
- Python: Version 3.6 or higher.
